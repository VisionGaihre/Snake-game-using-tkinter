It is an immersive "Snake game" made using tkinter in python.
I've seperated the classes made for snake & food.
Random library is used to "summon" food at any random location within the playable area.
Also I've added a mechanic which at every 5 score interval increases the speed making the snake slitther faster.
I've defined a class for checking collusion into the borders and the body parts.
Game is considered over after any kind of collusion and the canvas is complitly cleared.
